🔧 DIALOG POSITIONING ARCHITECTURE FIX

## Issue Resolved:
Card deletion confirmation dialog was flickering and positioning inconsistently due to being rendered at the card component level, causing interference from:
- CSS transforms on card hover states
- Relative positioning within card containers
- Mouse movement triggering card effects

## Solution Implemented:
✅ Moved all dialogs from DueDateCard to DashboardContent (page level)
✅ Implemented callback architecture: onRequestDelete(card) → page-level dialog
✅ Enhanced positioning with z-index: 100 and explicit position: fixed
✅ Proper backdrop and dialog layering throughout component hierarchy

## Components Updated:
- DueDateCard.tsx: Removed local dialog state, added onRequestDelete callback
- HorizontalCardColumns.tsx: Pass-through callback architecture
- DashboardContent.tsx: Centralized dialog management at page level
- ConfirmationDialog.tsx: Enhanced positioning with inline styles
- DeletionProgressDialog.tsx: Consistent z-index and positioning
- SuccessNotification.tsx: Fixed positioning for notifications

## Result:
- 🎯 No more dialog flickering or position jumping
- 📱 Consistent behavior regardless of card location
- 🖱️ Mouse movement doesn't interfere with dialog display
- 🎨 Smooth, professional dialog experience across all screens

This architectural change ensures dialogs render predictably above all content.
