🎯 MAJOR UX IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

## Card Connection Flow Enhancements:
✅ Cards now appear in 1-2 seconds (vs 30+ seconds previously)
✅ Loading shows accurate progress with clear messaging
✅ Rate limit errors (Wells Fargo) handled gracefully without blocking
✅ Background transaction sync doesn't prevent card visibility
✅ Cache clearing ensures fresh data on new connections
✅ Complete card data (including billing cycles) loads before display

## Card Deletion Flow Improvements:
❌ BEFORE: Browser confirm() → 20+ second background sync → awkward Chrome popup
✅ AFTER: Elegant modal → 1-2 second progress indicator → immediate UI updates

## Technical Architecture Changes:
- PlaidLink: Simplified from complex polling to quality-first approach
- Sync API: Rate limits no longer fail entire process
- DashboardContent: Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- New Components: ConfirmationDialog, DeletionProgressDialog, SuccessNotification

## User Experience Impact:
- 🚀 15x faster card visibility (30s → 2s)
- 🎨 Professional dialog UI replaces browser alerts
- 📊 Complete data loads once vs partial + manual refresh
- ⚡ Smooth animations and progress feedback
- 🛡️ Robust error handling for bank API limits

These changes fundamentally improve the core user flows of adding and removing cards.
